# Search Workbench
Search Workbench is an alternative interface to PubMed that is optimized around the idea of dealing with searches as discrete units in and of themselves.

Search results are visualized as Venn diagrams and by-year charts. Importantly, completed searches can also be directly *compared* with one another as an aide to fine-tuning a search strategy.

Sessions can be saved in localStorage or as text files.
